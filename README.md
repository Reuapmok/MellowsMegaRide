# MellowsMegaRide

This is Mellows Mega Ride, a student project developed over the course of one semester by three master students from the University of Applied Sciences FH Technikum Wien. 

This project is currently not worked at, but feel free to explore the source code for inspiration. 

For legal reasons a lot of content (market place or bought from third party sites) is stripped.

The project uses Unreal Engine 4.23.
Inside the Unreal Editor select "rund dedicated server" and start with the number of clients you need (up to 4 is intended).
